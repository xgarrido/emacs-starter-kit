* Starter Kit Site Lisp
The purpose of this code is to download, if necessary, missing lisp code that
can not be retrieved through ELPA package. Maybe this can be better done using
[[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] package. No update mechanism is implemented but in the same time, the
packages retrieved this way are not fashion enough (otherwise there have been
added to melpa).
